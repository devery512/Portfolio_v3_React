HELLO, 

If you're reading this than you have made it to what is now my new and imporved porfolio. 
For the front end of this website I am using react and as for the back end I am using my own custom api to gather data from my github as well as information from other places. Using external public apis. Follow me as I continue to improve this site as well as my abilities over the next couple of months. There might not be many changes made to the portfolio pages once done but checkout my other repos to see what else im working on.
